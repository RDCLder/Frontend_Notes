# Angular

## General

- Angular is a front-end JavaScript framework used to create single page applications (SPAs)
  - The single page is an index page in which DOM elements are changed based on user interaction
  - The DOM elements can be rendered without changing or reloading the page making for a more seamless UX
  - Unlike React, Angular is much more opinionated on how it should be used
