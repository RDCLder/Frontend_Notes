# React Native

## General

- [Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)

- React Native is an open-source, cross-platform mobile app framework created by Facebook.
  - Allows mobile developers to use React alongside native platform capabilities
  - Supports Android, iOS, and Universal Windows Platform
  
- React Native uses its own version of the virtual DOM
  - Directly interfaces with native platform by transpiling JavaScript into native language (e.g. Java, Swift, etc.)
  - DOM elements are abstracted into either cross-platform general elements (e.g. views for divs) or platform-specific components.
    - Android and iOS have different abstractions for some components
